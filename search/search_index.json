If you are willing to take the risk that comes with early stage code and are able to dive deep into Python, Javascript, Gstreamer, and Tensorflow code, then please keep reading. Otherwise click on the Watch button above (Releases Only option) to be notified when we release a stable end user version. How to run in development mode If you are interested to try the development version, follow these steps: 1. Clone this git repository. 2. ./ambianic-start.sh 3. Study config.yaml and go from there.

PipeElement PipeElement(self) The basic building block of an Ambianic pipeline. healthcheck PipeElement.healthcheck(self) Check the health of this element. :returns: (timestamp, status) tuple with most recent heartbeat timestamp and health status code ('OK' normally). heartbeat PipeElement.heartbeat(self) Set the heartbeat timestamp to time.monotonic(). stop PipeElement.stop(self) Receive stop signal and act accordingly. Subclasses should override this method by first invoking their super class implementation and then running through steps specific to stopping their ongoing sample processing. connect_to_next_element PipeElement.connect_to_next_element(self, next_element=None) Connect this element to the next element in the pipe. Subclasses should not have to override this method. receive_next_sample PipeElement.receive_next_sample(self, **sample) Receive next sample from a connected previous element. Subclasses should not have to override this method. :Parameters: **sample : dict A dict of (key, value) pairs that represent the sample. It is left to specialized implementations of PipeElement to specify their in/out sample formats and enforce compatibility with adjacent connected pipe elements. process_sample PipeElement.process_sample(self, **sample) Implement processing in subclass as a generator function. Invoked by receive_next_sample() when the previous element (or pipeline source) feeds another data input sample. Implementing subclasses should process input samples and yield output samples for the next element in the pipeline. :Parameters: **sample : dict A dict of (key, value) pairs that represent the sample. It is left to specialized implementations of PipeElement to specify their in/out sample formats and enforce compatibility with adjacent connected pipe elements. :Returns: processed_sample: dict Processed sample that will be passed to the next pipeline element. HealthChecker HealthChecker(self, health_status_callback=None) Monitor overall pipeline throughput health. Attaches at the end of a pipeline to monitor its health status based on received output samples and their frequency. process_sample HealthChecker.process_sample(self, **sample) Call health callback and pass on sample as is. ambianic.webapp","title":"Python API"},{"location":"ambianic-python-api/#ambianic","text":"","title":"ambianic"},{"location":"ambianic-python-api/#ambianicpipeline","text":"Main module for Ambianic AI pipelines.","title":"ambianic.pipeline"},{"location":"ambianic-python-api/#pipeelement","text":"PipeElement(self) The basic building block of an Ambianic pipeline.","title":"PipeElement"},{"location":"ambianic-python-api/#healthcheck","text":"PipeElement.healthcheck(self) Check the health of this element. :returns: (timestamp, status) tuple with most recent heartbeat timestamp and health status code ('OK' normally).","title":"healthcheck"},{"location":"ambianic-python-api/#heartbeat","text":"PipeElement.heartbeat(self) Set the heartbeat timestamp to time.monotonic().","title":"heartbeat"},{"location":"ambianic-python-api/#stop","text":"PipeElement.stop(self) Receive stop signal and act accordingly.
